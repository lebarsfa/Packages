    <summary>Mission Planner is a full-featured ground station application for the ArduPilot open source autopilot project.</summary>
    <description>
Mission Planner is a ground control station for Plane, Copter and Rover. Mission Planner can be used as a configuration utility or as a dynamic control supplement for your autonomous vehicle. Here are just a few things you can do with Mission Planner:
- Load the firmware (the software) into the autopilot board (i.e. Pixhawk series) that controls your vehicle.
- Setup, configure, and tune your vehicle for optimum performance.
- Plan, save and load autonomous missions into you autopilot with simple point-and-click way-point entry on Google or other maps.
- Download and analyze mission logs created by your autopilot.
- Interface with a PC flight simulator to create a full hardware-in-the-loop UAV simulator.
- With appropriate telemetry hardware you can:
  - Monitor your vehicleâ€™s status while in operation.
  - Record telemetry logs which contain much more information the the on-board autopilot logs.
  - View and analyze the telemetry logs.
  - Operate your vehicle in FPV (first person view).
