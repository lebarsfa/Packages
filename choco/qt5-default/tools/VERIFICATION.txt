VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The purpose of this package is to be more or less the equivalent of https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/qt5-default. It uses https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall (which requires Python) to install the latest LTS version of Qt 5 SDK, and prepare a configuration file for Qt Creator to detect that SDK. The MinGW version is chosen as the current one available on GitHub Actions.
