VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The purpose of this package is to be more or less the equivalent of https://packages.ubuntu.com/focal/libopencv-dev. The MinGW/GCC version is chosen as the current one available on GitHub Actions. Note that the existing https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/OpenCV official package does not provide binaries for MinGW/GCC.

This package is generated from https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages. The automated build log of the binaries can be seen by clicking on "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x64" and "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x86" jobs on https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/actions/workflows/libopencv-dev.4.2.0.yml, and signing in with GitHub. In particular, a sha256 checksum is visible for each generated .exe, as it is computed in .github/workflows/libopencv-dev.4.2.0.yml using checksum command. Those temporary .exe are available on https://github.com/lebarsfa/Packages/releases and are used by this package (they can be extracted using e.g. 7z and their content can be compared using e.g. WinMerge).
