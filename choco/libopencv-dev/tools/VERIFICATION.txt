VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
This package is generated from https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv, which is a fork of https://github.com/opencv/opencv (the official OpenCV GitHub source repository, the modifications made can be listed on https://github.com/opencv/codac/compare/3.2.0...lebarsfa:3.2.0). The automated build log can be seen by clicking on "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x64" and "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x86" jobs on https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv/actions/workflows/unixmatrix.yml, and signing in with GitHub. In particular, a sha256 checksum is visible for each generated .nupkg, as it is computed in .github/workflows/unixmatrix.yml using checksum command. Those temporary .nupkg are available on https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv/releases and are used to create this package : it can be checked e.g. using WinMerge that x86 folder from this package contains the bin, include, lib, share folders from the "--x86" package on GitHub and all the other folders are from the non-"--x86" package.
