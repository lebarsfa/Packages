VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community
in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.
 
The purpose of this package is to be more or less the equivalent of https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/libopencv-dev. The MinGW version is chosen as the current one available on GitHub Actions.

This package is generated from https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv, which is a fork of https://github.com/opencv/opencv (the official OpenCV GitHub source repository, the modifications made can be listed on https://github.com/opencv/codac/compare/3.2.0...lebarsfa:3.2.0). The automated build log can be seen by clicking on "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x64" and "Windows MinGW 8.1.0 x86" jobs on https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv/actions/workflows/unixmatrix.yml, and signing in with GitHub. In particular, a sha256 checksum is visible for each generated .nupkg, as it is computed in .github/workflows/unixmatrix.yml using checksum command. Those temporary .nupkg are available on https://github.com/lebarsfa/opencv/releases and are used to create this package : it can be checked e.g. using WinMerge that x86 folder from this package contains the bin, include, lib, share folders from the "--x86" package on GitHub and all the other folders are from the non-"--x86" package.
